# Tensorflow Object Detection API for Gun detectiom

## Objective
Train an object detection model to detect guns. 

## Strategy
The recent development in computer vision is remarkable and a number of new models have been proposed and the pre-trained models are provided.

## Instruction
### A. Run on Colab
Everything included in the notebook  `object-detection-tf2.ipynb` is for TensorFlow v2

All you need is run one of these notebooks on Google Colab.
If you clone the repo, change the repo URL to your own.
```
# Repo URL
repo_url = 'https://github.com/mpvasilis/object-detection-guns'
```
